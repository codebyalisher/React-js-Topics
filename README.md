redux ko use krny ka treqa-->
1 create store 2 wrap app component in index.js with provider tag,es provider ko btana b h knsa store use krna h so ek prop es me write kre gy asy store={name of store}3es k bd slice create krna h jo k ek function using createslice function,es m initial state ko set kr skty hn separately b aur phr usko yaha assign kr dy gy ya esi k andr aur eska name b set krty hn ,aur reducers define krty hn jo k basically functions huty hn jo state ko change krny kliy use huty hn aur phr end pe en sb reducers ko export krna huta h using slicename.actions aur phr es k bd store m ek reducer property huti h usko ja kr jo reducer bnaya huga assign kr dy gy aur esko json me likhna h jo name property use ki thi reducer m wo aur esko phr jo reducer ka name dy gy es file m wo assign kr dy gy q k jaha esko import kiya jaay ga waha koi b eska name rakh skty hn aur phr usko assign kr dy gy aesa krny se he store m states aa sky gi aur phr unko access kr sky gy
4 ab jis component m b state ko use krna h us kliy useselector hook ka use kry gy aur phr he us state ko access kr paay gy asy likhna h useselector (stateobject variable)=>(stateobject variable. reducername.statename)
5ye tha state ko access krna hu tu but agr state ko change krna hu tu phr dispatch ka use krty hn tu es kliy actions ko import kre gy aur enko phr usedispatch m use kr dy gy ,es kliy pehly eska object create kr le aur call back function m dispatch object ko action pass kr dy gy but ye action ko pehly import b krna h, that's the use of reduc
A-aur esi store m aur b bht c states ko store kiya ja skta procedure yahe same rahega sb kliy
B-aur ye redux tb use krty hn jb state ko globally sb components ko pass krna hu,usestate jb ek feature ya component m state ko change krna hu, context API b us kr skty hn but us m state ko uplift krna prta h children se parent ko aur phr parent se us particular component ko assign kr dy gy,aesa krny m issue ye huta h k un components m b state ko import krna prta h jaha use ni krna huta esko aur code increase huta h aur performance weak huti h
Dependencies:
dependencies that is required for the software to be run .i.e bootstrap ka add krna project me aur phr project ko server pe tun krvaany kliy b tu ye chaay hugi warna software responsive ni rahega ,ye mtlb dependency packages ka collection b hu skti h aur esko agr version k saath le kr chlna hu aur bki sb team k saath tu phr npm ko use kiya ja skta h

Material UI:
import React from 'react';
import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    background: 'linear-gradient(45deg, #FE6B8B 30%, #FF8E53 90%)',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 3,
    boxShadow: '0 3px 5px 2px rgba(255, 105, 135, .3)',
    color: 'white',
    height: 48,
    padding: '0 30px',
  },
});
export default function Hook() {
  const classes = useStyles();
  return <Button className={classes.root}>Hook</Button>;
}
As you can see in this example, we're using the makeStyles function to generate a hook called useStyles which create a CSS classes object which contains the keys of the styles object we created. In this example, it doesn't actually matter that we call this class root, because we reference it like a variable when we add it to the Button's className prop. As you will read in the advanced customization guide:

Every component provides a className property which is always applied to the root element.

That's so important! That means we can always safely overwrite the root element's CSS. In this above example, we are changing the Button's background color, height, text color. Did you know that the Button is just a simple HTML <button> tag with a <span> for the text? There's a simplicity to underlying HTML that you should get to know.

This is pretty much it, taken from a contained Button example:

<button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-contained MuiButton-containedPrimary" tabindex="0" type="button">
    <span class="MuiButton-label">Primary</span>
    <span class="MuiTouchRipple-root"></span>
</button>
How to style inner HTML elements in Material UI
Okay so you might be wondering, how to I know how to target these inner HTML elements of Material UI? Where is this documented? Welcome to CSS rules! Let's quote from the "Overriding styles with classes" section. Read the following very closely!

When the className property isn't enough, and you need to access deeper elements, you can take advantage of the classes object property to customize all the CSS injected by Material-UI for a given component. The list of classes for each component is documented in the component API page, you should refer to the CSS section and rule name column. For instance, you can have a look at the Button CSS API. Alternatively, you can use the browser dev tools.

To summarize, you can find the names of the CSS rules in the second half of the component's API page. For the Button, you can see that there is a root rule, and a label rule. If you're too lazy to go to the API page and just want to inspect the HTML, you can see above that there is a -label rule right on the <span> element. Target that rule by using the classes prop with an object containing those keys from your classes you got from useStyles.

That looks like this:

<Button
  classes={{
    root: classes.root, // class name, e.g. classes-nesting-root-x
    label: classes.label, // class name, e.g. classes-nesting-label-x
  }}
>
  classes nesting
</Button>
